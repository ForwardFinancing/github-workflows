> **Warning**
> 
> ## This is a public repo!
>
> **Be extra careful with any commits that you make to this repo.**
>
> GitHub [does not support calling reusable workflows from private repos](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#limitations), so until / unless GitHub adds support for calling them from private repos, this repo needs to be public.
>
> Some steps you can take to make sure we keep this repo safe:
>
> - Pair with a CI/CD SME and/or someone from the S&C team
>   - This will help catch any issues early, before they've been pushed up to the repo
> - [Squash commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6934752/combining-multiple-commits-before-pushing-in-git) on your branches before pushing them up for code review
>   - This will help avoid leaking secrets that might have been commited during local development, but are not obviously in a PR
